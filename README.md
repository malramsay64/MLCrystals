# MLCrystals

The detection and classification of local structural order
is a problem which has been studied extensively in a small number of systems,
namely spherical particles and water.
These two systems offer a limited insight into
the diversity of crystals structures available,
particularly those found in molecular crystals.

This is a project to develop tools and approaches
for detecting and classifying structure within simulation data.
Where structure is any arrangement of molecules of interest,
whether that be a highly ordered crystal
or a particular disordered state.

The goals of the project are as follows:

- Open and reproducible
- Communal resource
- Develop a reference workflow for the creation of labelled training datasets
- Create machine learning algorithms for the classification of
    arbitrary crystal structures trained from labelled data
- Create tools for the unsupervised classification of local structure.
