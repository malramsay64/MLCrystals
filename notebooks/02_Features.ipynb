    "In the [previous notebook](01_Trimer_Visualisation.ipynb) we visualised the configuration\n",
    "using the colour to encode the orientation of each molecule.\n",
    "This approach resulting in a clear visual distinction between\n",
    "the orientational ordering of the crystal structures\n",
    "and the disorder of the liquid phase.\n",
    "Here we are looking at finding a series of *features* which\n",

    "\n",
    "For this machine learning task for each molecule we want\n",
    "a series of properties, known in Machine Learning as *features*.\n",
    "The way of thinking about features is\n",
