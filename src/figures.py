    When running an interface simulation there is a region in which the molecules are
    not integrated, being the internal crystal region, while all the surrounding
    material is melted. This calculates the boundaries of that region from the length of
    the x and y coordinates of the simulation cell.

        x_len: The length of the x component of the simulation cell
        y_len: The length of the y component of the simulations cell
        factor: The fraction of each side of the box which remains crystalline
        buffer: Size of the buffer region around the interface. This is to help
            the machine learning algorithm by not introducing molecular
            configurations which are confusing and ill defined.
